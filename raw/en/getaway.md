We seat out in the sun

Outside beloved Jesuralem

To pay Caesar Augustus

We're under Herod's hand - The Romans rape and pillage our land

The land that God gave to us

But we're going to make a getaway

When the Savior comes to take away our pain

King David prophesied there'll come a Son with God on his side 

To conquer our enemies

I wish he'd come right now - turn Caesar's sword into a plow

Come, Savior, hear our plea

But we're going to make a getaway

When the Savior comes to take away our pain

Yes, we're waiting for a better day

When the glory's restored to Israel again
