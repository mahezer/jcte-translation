Father, why have you forsaken me?

Behold Your Son

You have been with me all of my life

Father, look where they have taken me

I will obey now as You said to lay down my life

Father forgive them their envy and pride

They do not know whom they've crucified

Father forgive them and heal them too

They do not know what they do

Now I give my soul up to you
