I can feel Him coming, feel Him coming, prepare the way

He'll reveal us, He's come to heal us

He's come to save

Be baptized and turn back to God today

I am the voice that prepares the way

We can feel Him coming, feel Him coming alive today

Our hearts need washing that there'd 

Be nothing to block his way

I'm baptizing some this is God's desire

But one's gonna come with the spirit and fire!

He will gather the people into one

And lead to the heart of the rising sun

He will gather the people into one

He will heal the people where they are

And light up the world like the morning star

He will gather the people into one

I rejoice to see his day

See him ruling in his righteousness

With a fan He'll come and blow the chaff away

We rejoice to see His day

In love He'll stand victorious

The coming Christ who takes our sins away!

We can feel Him coming, feel Him coming alive today

(We rejoice to see His day)

He will deliver so come to the river be washed today

(We rejoice to see His day)

You know it's real, can you feel what the people say?

We've been waiting - for so long wating

Today's the day!

He willl gather the people into one

He willl gather the people into one

Look! The man who will bring us in

Behold the Lamb who will take our sin

There he stands the foundation stone

A man like the world has never known

Stronger than Rome

He'll make our way back home
